# String2Morse
A python script for the Raspberry Pi that translates a string into Morse code which is displayed in the console and a blinking LED. This uses a GPIO module from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO

#Usage
Wire up an LED to ground and a GPIO pin of your choosing. Make sure to change the pin variable accordingly. Then ruun the script! That's really all there is to it. You will be asked to input the string when the program is run.

Feel free to mess around with timing and display.
